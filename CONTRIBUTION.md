# How to Contribute to the repo?
- kindly name the file as "lab<number>_<program_problem>.c"
	- example - "lab1_insertion.c", "lab2_deletion.c"

- have the problem description of the program in comments at the beginning.

This is to be done so that less issues arise when both sections get interchanged programs with respect to lab number.

Thanks you.
